The goal of `ping` is to graph ping data using the [R programming language](https://cran.r-project.org/).

## Installation

If you have R installed already, you can install the development version of `ping` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) from an 
R console with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("d-morrison/ping")
```

## Example

Here is an example, reading data from a .txt file included in the package:

```{r example}
library(ping)
path_to_file = 
  fs::path_package(
  package = "ping",
  "extdata/data_2023-11-20.txt")

path_to_file |>
  process_pings_file() |>
  autoplot()
```
